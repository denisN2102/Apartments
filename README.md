# Apartments 

## Project Description

This project is an adaptive web application that showcases project cards with custom pagination and an image slider. The project uses React and React Hooks for rendering data retrieved through an API. The app features a responsive design that adjusts the number of items per page based on the screen size.

### Main Features:
- **Responsive Design** — the number of cards on a page changes based on screen width (1 item for small screens, multiple items for larger ones).
- **Custom Pagination** — implemented without external libraries, using React `useState`.
- **Image Slider** — users can navigate between images using buttons.
- **API Data Fetching** — retrieves project data using the fetch API.
- **Error Handling for API** — validates API responses, handles errors, and displays appropriate messages.

## Technologies Used

- **React** — a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks** — for managing state and lifecycle methods in functional components.
- **CSS** — for styling the application.
- **Fetch API** — for fetching data from a remote server.
